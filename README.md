# PROMPT PROGRAMMING

Prompt programming techniques enable using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build Autonomous agents through:
- use of LLMs chains,
- use of LLM workflows with or without external memory / tools / APIs.

Not all papers are specifically written about Prompt engineering, yet specific concepts in these papers are interesting from Prompt programming perspective.

[Prompt Sapper: LLM-Empowered Software Engineering Infrastructure for AI-Native Services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02230.pdf)

- Human AI collaborative intelligence methodology & technical practices, where the idea is not to have "full Auto-GPT" from user input to direct resolution by LLM, but rather human reviews steps between.
- Useer inputs objective, LLM asks clarification. Use then  User adds clarifications and LLM constructs AI chain for human to review. Finally LLM executes the AI chain with user acceptabnce tests.

# PROMPT ENGINEERING
Prompt engineering techniques are here considered "traditional" in sense of helping to to outperform vanilla LLM prompt, as their code idea. These Prompt engineering techniques are useful and popular. Therefore it is good to be familiar with them, too. This list is "an additional reading" to Prompt Programming, rather than a complete list of Prompt engineering.
