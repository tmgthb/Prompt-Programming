# Prompt-Programming

Curated list of Prompt programming techniques.

[ToolAlpaca: Generalized Tool Learning for Language Models with 3000 Simulated Cases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05301.pdf)


[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)

Enable believable human behavior: observation, planning, and reflection.

An agent wants to throw a Valentineâ€™s Day party. The agents autonomously spread invitations, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. 

[Task-driven Autonomous Agent Utilizing GPT-4, Pinecone, and LangChain for Diverse Applications](https://yoheinakajima.com/task-driven-autonomous-agent-utilizing-gpt-4-pinecone-and-langchain-for-diverse-applications/)

Task-driven autonomous agent, with vector database and Langchain. BabyGPT includes: Execution, creation and prioritization

Takes objective, pulls an item from task queue and moves it to execution agent with access to memory. 

[HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580)

A LLM (such as ChatGPT) accesses HuggingFace community to look AI models to complete the given task. 

It can read multi modalities by outsourcing tasks like image recognition to the specific image model. 

[ChatPipe: Orchestrating Data Preparation Program by
Optimizing Human-ChatGPT Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03540)

ChatPipe - Iterative, data preparation program with ChatGPT using 1. Operation Recommendation, 2.   Program generation, 3. Version management. 

Recommends next data preparation opration. Easily roll-back to previous program for version control.
