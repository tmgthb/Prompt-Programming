# PROMPT PROGRAMMING

Prompt programming techniques enable using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build Autonomous agents through:
- use of LLMs chains,
- use of LLM workflows with or without external memory / tools / APIs.

Not all papers are specifically written about Prompt engineering, yet specific concepts in these papers are interesting from Prompt programming perspective.

[ToolAlpaca: Generalized Tool Learning for Language Models with 3000 Simulated Cases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05301.pdf)

- Builds multi-agent simulation environment to generate dataset of using many real world apis. 
- Small models can achieve comparable performance to larger models on tool usage.

[SELFEVOLVE: A Code Evolution Framework via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02907.pdf)

- Generates intermediate code based on input prompt. 
- Use LLM to act as expert programmer to debug the generated code by receiving errors from Python interpreter.

[Prompt Sapper: LLM-Empowered Software Engineering Infrastructure for AI-Native Services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02230.pdf)

- Human AI collaborative intelligence methodology & technical practices, where the idea is not to have "full Auto-GPT" from user input to direct resolution by LLM, but rather human reviews steps between.
- Useer inputs objective, LLM asks clarification. Use then  User adds clarifications and LLM constructs AI chain for human to review. Finally LLM executes the AI chain with user acceptabnce tests.

[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)

- Enable believable human behavior: observation, planning, and reflection.
- An agent wants to throw a Valentineâ€™s Day party. The agents autonomously spread invitations, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time.

[HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580)

- A LLM (such as ChatGPT) accesses HuggingFace community to look AI models to complete the given task. 
- It can read multi modalities by outsourcing tasks like image recognition to the specific image model.
