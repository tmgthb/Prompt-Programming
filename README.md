# PROMPT PROGRAMMING

Part of the papers are not specifically around Prompt engineering, yet are included due to interesting conceptually from Prompt programming perspective. Prompt programming techniques enable using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build Autonomous agents through:
- use of LLMs chains,
- use of LLM workflows with or without external memory / tools / APIs.

[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)

- Enable believable human behavior: observation, planning, and reflection.
- An agent wants to throw a Valentineâ€™s Day party. The agents autonomously spread invitations, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time.
